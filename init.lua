    If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
    a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
      - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

    After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
    reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

require("keymaps")
